You are given a string s, consisting of lowercase alphabets. Your task is to remove consecutive duplicate characters from the string. 

Example:

Input: s = "aabb"
Output:  "ab" 
Explanation: 
The character 'a' at index 2 is the same as 'a' at index 1, so it is removed.
Similarly, the character 'b' at index 4 is the same as 'b' at index 3, so it is removed.
The final string is "ab".



Solution:


class Solution {
  public:
    string removeConsecutiveCharacter(string& s) {
        // code here.
        string res;
        res += s[0];
        
        for(int i = 1 ; i < s.length() ; i++){
            
            if(s[i] != s[i-1]){
               res += s[i]; 
            }
            
        }
        return res;
    }
};
